# Online Bookstore Database Management System
Description:
This project designs and implements a relational database for an online bookstore. The system stores and manages information about books, authors, customers, orders, and payments. Using SQL, it supports key operations such as adding new books, searching for books by title or author, managing customer accounts, processing orders, and generating sales reports. The project demonstrates database design (ER model, normalization), SQL queries (CRUD operations, joins, aggregate functions), and data integrity through constraints and relationships.

Key Features:
-Book catalog with categories and author details
-Customer registration and login
-Order placement and order history tracking
-Inventory and payment management
